**Today's Progress**: More fun with inline-block. Worked on some visual design lessons on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** Thinking I'm going to use the super hacky solution to my inline-block problem just to move forward, but it's one-time fix. I'll eventually need to get a real handle on inline-block so I can come up with solutions that work all the time.
